# `/text` Text Generation

## Command Usage

Use this command to generate an image that contains text.

These are the inline command options available:

* `input`: The text include in the generated image.
* `font`: The font chosen for the text.
* `size`: The size of the text in percentage of the image.
* `bold`: Whether the text should be bold.
* `italic`: Whether the text should be italic.
* `aspect-ratio`: The format of the resulting image output.
* `prompt`: Description of what you want in the generated image, if this is not provided a preview of your layout will be shown.
* `negative-prompt`: Description of what should NOT be in the image.

For better results it's good to describe what the text should be, something like: `a marble slat with carved marble letters and carved floral patterns and borders`

A pro-tip is that after you have done a command to get a preview, or generated an image you want to tweak, just press up in the desktop client to reuse your command. This does require that you haven't said anything else in chat after the previous command or you will be editing that instead.
